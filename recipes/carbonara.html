    <h2>Four-Cheese Chicken Carbonara</h2>
    <p>
      I came up with this chicken carbonara penne recipe when I had to either
      cook up a 3-pound package of lean thick-cut bacon or throw it out (which
      was not going to happen). I happened to have everything else on hand
      anyway. I've had friends try this, and they loved it. I hope you do, too!
