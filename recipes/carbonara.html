      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        When you're looking for something comforting and carb-y, nothing fits
        the bill like a good carbonara. This version adds a bit of protein by
        way of saut√©ed chicken breasts, making it the perfect quick and easy
        weeknight dinner. No fettuccine on hand? Spaghetti, linguine, or
        capellini would all be great instead. Happy slurping!

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to
          package directions until al dente. Drain, reserving 120ml pasta water,
          and return to pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon 5 minutes.
          Add garlic and cook until bacon is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more.
          Transfer to a bowl and drain half the fat in skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken to skillet and increase heat to medium-high. Season
          generously with salt and pepper and cook, flipping halfway through,
          until no longer pink, 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to low and return bacon to skillet. Toss, then add cooked
          pasta and toss until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, beat together eggs, Parmesan, and parsley and season
          with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour egg mixture over pasta and toss until coated, then add a couple
          tablespoons pasta water until creamy. (Add more pasta water by the
          tablespoonful as necessary.)
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with Parmesan and parsley and serve immediately.</li>
